# Crypto App

This app is built following the [@SwiftfulThinking](https://www.swiftful-thinking.com/) tutorial and added some custom modifications. The app allows users to check cryptocurrency information and manage their coin portfolios.

## Features
### Information
For cryptocurrency information, users can view the top 250 cryptocurrencies, including their names and prices. The list can be sorted by various properties. Users can also click on a coin to see its details, including weekly price data, a description, and other relevant information.

### Manage Portfolios
For managing the portfolio, users can view all the cryptocurrencies they've added. They can also add new coins, update existing ones, and remove coins from their portfolio.
